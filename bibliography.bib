	abstract = {Refactoring is the process of changing the structure of a program while preserving its behaviour. This behaviour preservation is crucial so that refactorings do not introduce any bugs. Refactoring is aimed at increasing code quality, programming productivity and code reuse. Refactoring has been practised manually by programmers for as long as programs have been written; however, with the advent of refactoring tools, refactoring can be performed semi-automatically, allowing refactorings to be performed (and undone) easily. In this paper, we briefly describe a number of refactorings implemented in the Haskell Refactorer, HaRe. In addition to this, we also implement a simple expression processor to demonstrate how some of the refactorings implemented in HaRe can be used to aid programmers in developing Haskell software.}

This paper introduces paraforming: a new approach to constructing parallel functional programs using formally-defined refactoring transformations. We introduce a number of new refactorings for Parallel Haskell that capture common parallel abstractions, such as divide-and-conquer and data parallelism, and show how these can be used by HaRe, the Haskell Refactorer. Using a paraforming approach, we are able to easily obtain significant and scalable speedups (up to 7.8 on an 8-core machine).",

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new technique for introducing and tuning parallelism for heterogeneous shared-memory systems (comprising a mixture of CPUs and GPUs), using a combination of algorithmic skeletons (such as farms and pipelines), Monte--Carlo tree search for deriving mappings of tasks to available hardware resources, and refactoring tool support for applying the patterns and mappings in an easy and effective way. Using our approach, we demonstrate easily obtainable, significant and scalable speedups on a number of case studies showing speedups of up to 41 over the sequential code on a 24-core machine with one GPU. We also demonstrate that the speedups obtained by mappings derived by the MCTS algorithm are within 5--15{\%} of the best-obtained manual parallelisation.},

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.
