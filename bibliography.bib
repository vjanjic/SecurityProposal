  abstract = "We present a new programming model for deterministic parallel computation in a pure functional language. The model is monadic and has explicit granularity, but allows dynamic construction of dataflow networks that are scheduled at runtime, while remaining deterministic and pure. The implementation is based on monadic concurrency, which has until now only been used to simulate concurrency, rather than to provide parallelism, in functional languages. We present the API with its semantics, and argue that parallel execution is deterministic. Furthermore, we present a complete work-stealing scheduler implemented as a Haskell library, and we show that it performs at least as well as the existing parallel programming models in Haskell."

Implemented as a shallow embedding in Haskell, it provides a message-passing communication model, inspired by Erlang, without introducing incompatibility with Haskell's established shared-memory concurrency. A key contribution is a method for serializing function closures for transmission across the network. Cloud Haskell has been implemented; we present example code and some preliminary performance measurements."

model in which a network of steps (functions) communicate
through message-passing as well as a limited form of shared memory.
This paper describes a new implementation of CnC for Haskell.
Compared to existing parallel programming models for Haskell,
CnC occupies a useful point in the design space: pure and deterministic
like Strategies, but more explicit about granularity and
the structure of the computation, which affords the programmer
greater control over parallel performance. We present results on 4,
32, and 48-core machines demonstrating parallel speedups ranging
between 7X and 22X on non-trivial benchmarks.

 whatIsThis = {This paper discuss a couple of work-stealing load distribution algorithms for divide-and-conquer programs on
heterogeneous computing systems,
(basically, clusters connected by a wide-area networks). Some of the algorithms are new, some of them are already well known.
Algorithms compared : Random Stealing (RS), Random Pushing (RP), Cluster-aware Hierarchical Stealing (CHS), and two new ones :
Cluster-aware Load-based Stealing (CLS) and Cluster-aware Random Stealing.
RS : + simple, good performance on single cluster, - : lots of messages sent to remote cluster
RP : + asynchronous communication, therefore less sensitive to wide-area nets, - : not stable, pushing jobs to overloaded PEs 
presents unnecessary overhead
CHS : organize PEs in clusters into tree-like structure, always fish down the tree, and if negative response is received, then fish
up, only one PE fishes outside the cluster. + : locality of work requests, - : root node of a cluster waits for the whole cluster to
become idle before sending fishes to different cluster, fishing inside cluster may result in finer-grained jobs to be stolen (and this is bad?!)
CLS : random steling inside cluster, work prefetching from different cluster. - : needs a lot of tunable parameters (how much work to import from
different cluster, when to look for more work), + : PEs are idle less time than in CHS, fewer number of wide area msgs 
CRS : random stealing inside the cluster, when idle, send fish to remote cluster, but don't wait for its response; continue to fish inside the cluster,
if work arrives from outside cluster, consider it as a prefetched work
Their tests show that CRS is performing the best for 11 out of 12 tested programs.

this paper describes a fault tolerant task scheduler and its performance analysis. the task scheduler integrates work stealing

reschedules it to some idle PE). maybe interesting, read it again.

  abstract = {FastFlow is a programming framework specifically targeting cache-coherent shared-memory multicores. It is implemented as a stack of C++ template libraries built on top of lock-free (and memory fence free) synchronization mechanisms. Its philosophy is to combine programmability with performance. In this paper a new FastFlow programming methodology aimed at supporting parallelization of existing sequential code via offloading onto a dynamically created software accelerator is presented. The new methodology has been validated using a set of simple micro-benchmarks and some real applications.},

It is implemented as a stack of C++ template libraries built on top of lock-free (and memory fence free) synchronization mechanisms. Its philosophy is to combine programmability with performance. In this paper a new FastFlow programming methodology aimed at supporting parallelization of existing sequential code via offloading onto a dynamically created software accelerator is presented. The new methodology has been validated using a set of simple micro-benchmarks and some real applications.},

The extension is shaped in the form of a multithreaded Python module that offers high reliability and flexibility, rendering an overall inspection process that introduces low overhead. Additionally, we investigate the advantages and drawbacks of the RAPL power model, introduced in the Intel Xeon ``Sandy-Bridge'' CPU, versus a data acquisition system from National Instruments.",
