\begin{WPDescription}
  The goal of this workpackage is to provide mechanisms for identifying security problems in distributed big data storage and processing, focusing on machine-learning based data analytics. It will exploit the technologies for the source-code level analysis using symbolic execution (WPXX) to identify security risks that appear both in the individual data storage and processing agents in isolation, as well as from the interaction of these agents in distributed setting. In task \ref{task:storage} we will focus on the problem of identifying vulnerabilities in systems for storage of big data used to train the machine-learning models. These systems most often use distributed NoSQL databases, such as ScyllaDB or MongoDB, or plain distributed filesystems such as HDFS that use very basic security mechanisms. Complementary to that, task \ref{task:processing} focuses on machine-learning based distributed analysis of big data. We restrict our attention to the systems that are based on parallel patterns (most of which being built on top of MapReduce paradigm), as parallel patterns encapsulate all interaction between different distributed agents, therefore localising the possible source of vulnerabilities in the distributed systems. This work will feed into WPXX, where security properties of such systems will be formally established and proved. Task \ref{task:privacyLeakage} focuses on evaluating and reducing privacy-leakage in distributed machine learning, by investigating optimal noise-adding mechanisms for that. Task \ref{task:knowledgeSharing} investigates knowledge sharing in distributed machine learning, developing techniques for privacy-preserving transfer of knowledge extrated from large data sets. Finally, task \ref{task:healing} investigates implementing self-healing mechanisms developed in WPXX into the security and privacy-leakage diagnostics techniques developed in this workpackage. Collectively, the diagnostics and repair mechanisms for security and privacy of machine learning data analytics from this work package will feed feed into the refactoring-based self-healing methodology from WP6.

\tasklabel{task:storage}
In \theTask, we will define the methodology and conduct an analysis of vulnerabilities in big data storage such as NoSQL databases and file systems such as HDFS.  We will select examples of  NoSQL databases constructed in C++ or  based on the JVM ( Java and Scala for instance) and identify vulnerabilities in the source code that could lead to security risks. Open source projects will be selected so that we can exploit the technologies for the source-code level analysis using symbolic execution (WPXX) to identify security risks that appear both in the individual data storage and processing agents in isolation, as well as from the interaction of these agents in distributed setting. In particular, side projects (such as language drivers) will be examined as these provide a attack vector that may be outside the open source projects control.

 \tasklabel{task:processing}
 In \theTask, we will define the methodology and conduct an analysis of vulnerabilities in big data analysis systems.  These systems provide their own security challenges as data is distributed across a great many systems and whilst analysis is in process the data may be transferred across nodes.  We will not tackle the security of the data whilst it is on the move (on the wire and the network stack) as they are the subject of other research areas.  The task will follow a similar pattern to that of \ref{task:storage} selecting candidates systems from those written in C++ or based on the JVM (Hadoop, Spark, Flink, Storm) exploiting source-code level analysis using symbolic execution (WPXX) to expose security vulnerabilities.

  \tasklabel{task:privacyLeakage}
  In this task, we will develop mechanisms to both evaluate and reduce information leakage in distributed machine learning data analytics systems. The methods for evaluation of privacy leakage will be investigated in terms of relationship between sensitive data and released public data. Our approach is to employ a stochastic model for approximating the uncertain mapping between released noise added data and private data. The stochastic model facilitates a variational approximation of privacy-leakage in-terms of mutual information between sensitive private data and released public data. For reducing information leakage, we will develop optimal noise adding mechanisms for preserving privacy in distributed machine learning. We will derive analytically the noise distribution that maximizes a given utility function or equivalently minimizes a given data distortion function. Different use cases may demand different utility functions and thus optimal noise adding mechanism is derived for each utility function separately.

  \tasklabel{task:knowledgeSharing}
  This task will develop an analytical framework to study and optimize the privacy-preserving transfer of knowledge extracted from a large set of labelled private data owned by a party to another party owning a few labelled data samples. The goal is to answer the question: how can a model be transferred from a source to a target domain while preserving privacy of both source and target domains? An information theoretic approach is considered to quantify transferability of knwoledge from source to target domain in-terms of mutual information between source and target data. The privacy secured knowledge sharing framework facilitates development of transfer and multi-task machine learning algorithm while optimizing the privacy-transferability tradeoff.

  In \theTask, we will integrate self-healing mechanisms developed in WPXX into the tools and techniques developed in this work package. Collectively, the diagnostics and repairs of security vulnerabilities developed in this work package will feed into the refactoring-based self-healing methodology from WP6. A sample use case from one of the technologies surveyed in \ref{task:storage}, \ref{task:processing}in  will be selected to demonstrate the application of self healing to that technology.
