\begin{WPObjectives}
The objectives of \theWP{} are to:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Define security metrics and policies for identity, authentication and access management;
\item Develop multi-factor authentication schemes and %continuous 
user identification methods based on intelligent biometrics;
\item Develop mechanisms for regulating access and tracking the lineage and provenance of data using a Blockchain-based approach;
\item Design and develop an integrated identity management service, including an interactive dashboard for service integration and analytics;
\item Design, develop and evaluate privacy-preserving methods of biometric data.
\end{compactitem}
\end{WPObjectives}

\begin{WPDescription}
\theWP{} will design and develop an AI-driven and user-centered IDentity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) that will allow developers to integrate core identity management components in their applications, aiming to preserve security while providing a positive security experience to the end users. The primary goals are to: i) provide high levels of security through multi-factor authentication and continuous user identification to confirm the identity of each end-user and accordingly authorise access to parts of data in the system; ii) improve the usability and user experience through easy-to-use and fluid authentication and continuous user identification methods; and, iii) enable developers and administrators to easily integrate, deploy and manage their preferred authentication method based on custom requirements and policies. We will design security metrics and policies based on the state-of-the-art security and usability metrics of token- and biometric-based user authentication schemes (T5.1). We will also design and develop working prototypes of multi-factor authentication and continuous user identification based on intelligent biometrics (T5.2) and develop data access control mechanisms using a Blockchain-based approach (T5.3). In T5.4 we will design and develop an integrated identity management service, including an interactive dashboard for service integration and analytics and in T5.5 we will design, develop and evaluate privacy-preserving methods of biometric data.

%\theTask will design and develop the core identification and authentication component. In particular, we will design and develop a series of multi-factor authentication (MFA) schemes, and continuous user identification methods aiming to augment the existing security layer of distributed data analytics applications with intelligent biometrics. Continuous authentication will be achieved by combining: i) face biometrics through face recognition and analysis; ii) eye gaze behavior biometrics by analyzing the end users' eye gaze data and visual behavior during interaction; and iii) physiological biometrics by analyzing the end users' physiological data such as heart rate, skin conductance, accelerometer, etc. through non-intrusive wearable sensing devices (e.g., smartwatches, smartbands).

%A User-Centered Design methodology will be adopted for developing and finalising the MFA and continuous user identification scheme through multiple iterations (three releases are anticipated; initial, refined, final software) that will be used for evaluation studies. The developed schemes and methods will be evaluated through experiments with synthetic data as well as actual users (as part of WP7) aiming to evaluate its security and usability aspects. In the context of conducting studies with actual users with the developed service, we assure that all personal data collection and processing will be carried out according to EU and national legislation. This task will proceed in three phases. In the first phase, we will produce low-fidelity working prototypes with limited functionality as well as paper prototypes based on users’ requirements analysis, resulting in deliverable D5.2 (M9). In the second phase, the service will be further developed into an extended working prototype including almost all functional requirements, however that has not been optimized in terms of performance and user experience. This will produce deliverable D5.3 (M22). A fully functional identity management service will be developed in the third phase, resulting in deliverable D5.4 (M34). Emphasis will be given to the interoperability of the components and maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the service running on different platforms (desktop, mobile, wearable devices). The service will be validated based on benchmarking software criteria and qualities ensuring the adequate performance, robustness, scalability, maintainability and security. \COGNIshort{} will lead this task, contributing their expertise in identity management. \USTANshort{} will contribute feedback from formal verification of security and privacy. \SOPRAshort{} will provide feedback from the use cases.

%We will design and develop a decentralized access control system based on Blockchain technology. In particular, the implemented system will store tamper-free data, such as auditing data, on the Blockchain network, in order to guarantee that the auditing records cannot be altered. In a similar way, access control rules will be stored on the Blockchain network and the owner of the data will be responsible for updating them. This will allow the authorization to be performed over the Blockchain network and will allow developers to seamlessly integrate it in the applications. When a certain component of the developer's application requires authorization of a user and verification of her access rights, it will send a transaction to the decentralized Blockchain network. Since there will not be any centralized authority responsible for validating the access rights, the risk of single point of failure will be eliminated. After the validation of access rights, the Blockchain will respond back to the requestor component. This will respect data privacy since the particular component will not be able to disclose any data without reaching the Blockchain network. This task will proceed in three phases. In the first phase, we will produce low-fidelity working prototypes with limited functionality. In the second phase, the access control system will be further developed into an extended working prototype including almost all functional requirements, however that has not been optimized in terms of performance and user experience.

\theTask will develop an interactive dashboard to allow developers and administrators to setup their preferred authentication methods and policies, access control, and compile and display users’ interaction and behaviour data to monitor their experience and highlight any usability issues. In addition, we will design and develop tools and methods for providing easy and intuitive access to the users’ interaction data collected in different formats (e.g., data and information visualisations and tabular representations). %It will also support various filtering and aggregation options to focus on a particular subset of the collected data based on, for e.g., time and threshold filters. 
The interactive dashboard will translate the raw data into inferred knowledge, which will be be useful for the experimental evaluation in WP7. It will be integrated in the overall system's intelligent user interface in WP6. This task will proceed in three phases, similar to the task T5.2 and T5.3.

%Bearing in mind that users' biometric data are irrevocable when exposed, it is very important to protect their privacy. 
\theTask{} will design, develop and evaluate new methods for preserving the privacy of the biometric data used for multi-factor authentication and continuous user identification, enabling users to verify themselves without disclosing sensitive biometric information. For doing so, current privacy weaknesses and threats in biometric authentication will be analysed, and novel privacy-preserving methods will be designed and developed to secure the implementation of biometric-based authentication, such as, features' transformation, cancelable biometrics and pseudo-identities. This task will proceed in three phases, providing privacy-preserving features for the initial (D5.1), refined (D5.2) and final version (D5.3) of the identity management system from T5.2. \UODshort{} will lead this task, contributing their expertise in big data systems with \FRQshort{} and \COGNIshort{} providing feedback on the developed privacy-preserving mechanisms and the developed identity management methods and tools.
