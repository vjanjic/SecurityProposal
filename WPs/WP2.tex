In \theTask, we will develop advanced vulnerability detection technology for C/C++ code. We plan to apply IBM's ExpliSAT symbolic interpretation tool to discover known security vulnerability patterns in C/C++code. Moreover, to avoid known limitations of the symbolic execution approach (e.g. path explosion, memory growth, etc.), we will develop a technology that leverages the combination of symbolic execution, static code analysis and white box fuzzing to find exploitable bugs. The idea is to perform symbolic execution as the main technique to discover vulnerabilities combined with tailored fuzzing techniques in specific small areas for the purpose of assisting the symbolic execution engine to consistently make progress. For that end, the symbolic execution engine will query a fuzzer at run-time for information that would assist the symbolic interpreter make progress where it previously couldn't. Static code analysis will assist to find suspected vulnerability locations prior to the invocation of the ExpliSAT tool and to control "hard to execute" use cases.

This task will proceed in three phases ...

Starting from the YAG-Suite capabilities, in \theTask we will provide and improve the advanced vulnerability detection technology which is acheivable with SAST for JAVA and C/C++ source code. To avoid the recurring problem of false positives and duplicate warnings raising from scanning, the results generated by Static Analysis will be automatically qualified by a supervised machine learning based post-processing of SAST warnings. 
The qualification process will support a risk based approach and provide decision making information for each warning such as its relevancy and its impact on CVSS metrics such as confidentiality, integrity, etc.
Vulnerability detection will also include a remediation focus to provide options for fixing vulnerabilities and extract, when available, examples of correct source code as (and when) found in the application.
The YAG-Suite will offer an API to partners so that they can query the SAST results they need.
Static code analysis will assist to find suspected vulnerability locations prior to the invocation of the ExpliSAT tool and after, in order to refine ”hard to detect” vulnerabilities.

In a first step it will be analysed which run-time data has to be collected through monitoring machines that are needed for the detection of any anomaly, i.e. there are agents in the distributed concurrent system that interact with the other agents in a malicious way. This requires the specification of monitoring agents. The second step addresses the development of anomaly detection algorithms and their specification by further agents. The focus will be on discovery, whether the interaction sequence of any agent is in line with the specified system. The third step
addresses adaptation algorithm in case a security violation is detected or a suspicious agents
has been detected that should be removed from the system. Both cases require the partial interrupt of the distributed concurrent system, the rollback to a consistent state and the restart after some modifications. The last step undertaken in this task is the formulation of repairability proof obligations on the grounds of the research through which it will be specified, after how many steps a secure situation is expected to be restored.
