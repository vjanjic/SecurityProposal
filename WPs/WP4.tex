\begin{WPObjectives}
The objectives of \theWP{} are to:
\begin{compactitem}
%% Why just embedded? Are these domains correct? KH
\item Develop a formal high-level multi-tier specification language; % able to capture different levels of abstraction; %and security contracts
\item Define abstraction/refinement as a bidirectional transformation between specifications across tiers;
% How is distribution considerd?
%BOTH for source code and code patterns that represent known vulnerabilities 
%and relate different levels of abstraction (from models to code)
\item Define a notion of behavioural equivalence also suitable to formalise refactorings. Extend this to formalise security-preserving equivalences and certificates.
\item Define a logic suitable to capture 
properties of interest (e.g., distributed stochastic temporal logic) interpreted over (distributed) traces of execution 
\item Define a framework combining theorem provers and SMT solvers to prove the correctness in all of the above, and search for a subset of traces of execution that satisfy certain parameters (meets a certain threshold for instance);
\item Explore an interplay between runtime verification and exhaustive formal verification;
\item Develop a novel mechanism for automated 
vulnerability localisation, containment, recovery and repair.

\end{compactitem}

\vspace*{1cm}

Still working on this... need some inspiration on what can be novel.
Need to talk about privacy as well, not just security.

self-healing

static vs dynamic

dynamic patching?

All of the above need to be revised to include Flavio's work, proof-braids, and similar notions.

Notes: very relevant paper on transaction controller TACTL over Abstract state machines - multi-level...
It includes a handler that can deal with deadlock, recovery, commit abort... 


%Needs to be related to WP4 and vulnerabilities

\begin{WPDescription}
%\theWP{} addresses the problem of solving the world.

The goal of \theWP{} is to provide mechanisms for specifying and verifying code with respect to
(security) properties in distributed big data storage and processing
