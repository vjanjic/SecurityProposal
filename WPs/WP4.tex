\begin{WPObjectives}
The objectives of \theWP{} are to:
\begin{compactitem}
%% Why just embedded? Are these domains correct? KH
\item Develop a formal high-level multi-tier specification language; % able to capture different levels of abstraction; %and security contracts
\item Define abstraction/refinement as a bidirectional transformation between specifications across tiers;
% How is distribution considerd?
%BOTH for source code and code patterns that represent known vulnerabilities 
%and relate different levels of abstraction (from models to code)
\item Define a notion of behavioural equivalence also suitable to formalise refactorings. Extend this to formalise security-preserving equivalences and certificates.
\item Define a logic suitable to capture 
properties of interest (e.g., distributed stochastic temporal logic) interpreted over (distributed) traces of execution 
\item Define a framework combining theorem provers and SMT solvers to prove the correctness in all of the above, and search for a subset of traces of execution that satisfy certain parameters (meets a certain threshold for instance);
\item Explore an interplay between runtime verification and exhaustive formal verification;
\item Develop a novel mechanism for automated 
vulnerability localisation, containment, recovery and repair.

\end{compactitem}

\vspace*{1cm}

Still working on this... need some inspiration on what can be novel.
Need to talk about privacy as well, not just security.

self-healing

static vs dynamic

dynamic patching?

All of the above need to be revised to include Flavio's work, proof-braids, and similar notions.

Notes: very relevant paper on transaction controller TACTL over Abstract state machines - multi-level...
It includes a handler that can deal with deadlock, recovery, commit abort...

\begin{WPDescription}
%\theWP{} addresses the problem of solving the world.

The goal of \theWP{} is to provide mechanisms for specifying and verifying code with respect to
(security) properties in distributed big data storage and processing

In \theTask, we will define the mechanisms to represent security contracts
in such a way that they can be mapped to concrete syntax in different
programming languages. We will also support the extraction of those contracts
from existing source code allowing iterative approaches where contracts
are refined by developers.

In \theTask, we will focus on the dynamic analysis of contracts for
those vulnerabilities that cannot be prooved by formal verification
without running the software component.
