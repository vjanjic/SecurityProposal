\begin{WPObjectives}
The objectives of \theWP{} are to:
\begin{compactitem}
\item	Determine the overall requirements for tools and use cases that will be developed in \TheProject{};
\item Determine the success metrics for demonstrating that the \TheProject{} project achieves the determined objectives;
\item	Identify and implement real-world use cases from air traffic management, healthcare and banking domains that will demonstrate \TheProject{} tools and techniques;
\item	Evaluate the \TheProject{} technologies and techniques on the developed use cases and against the expected results;
\item	Provide a technical roadmap for long-term development and use of the \TheProject tools and technologies.
\end{compactitem}
\end{WPObjectives}

\begin{WPDescription}
The purpose of this work package is to evaluate the \TheProject technology on real-world use cases from the \emph{air traffic}, \emph{healthcare} and \emph{banking} domains. In all these domains, ensuring security of data analytics, privacy of data access, as well as ensuring the quality of data, is of utmost importance. We will therefore i) define the requirements and success metrics that the \TheProject{} technologies and use cases will need to satisfy in order to achieve the desired results and expected impacts, as set out in project objectives (\ref{task:requirements}); ii) adapt the \TheProject{} \emph{data fabrication} technique to the particular use cases considered, therefore providing the use cases with large volumes of synthetic ---but realistic--- data on which it is safe to develop and test the \TheProject{} techniques (\ref{task:datafab}); iii) adapt the existing, and develop new, use cases that will demonstrate that the \TheProject{} tools and techniques can support development of secure and privacy preserving distributed data analytics application for end users (\ref{task:usecases}); and, iv)  evaluate the effectiveness and benefits that our techniques will bring in terms of the success metrics identified in~\ref{task:requirements}, and produce a roadmap for addressing the issues that will arise from the usage of the \TheProject{} technology for future-generation secure big data analytics systems (\ref{task:evaluation}). The adaptation of data fabrication techniques, use cases and evaluation will proceed in three phases. In the \emph{first} phase, we will develop an initial version of use cases and fabricated data, and evaluate these on private clouds (reported in~\ref{del:eval1}). In the \emph{second} phase, we will extend and evaluate these use cases, and produce additional data for deployment on public clouds (reported in~\ref{del:eval2}). In the \emph{third} and final phase, the use cases and fabricated data will be adapted and evaluated for deployment on hybrid clouds (reported in~\ref{del:eval3}).

In \theTask{}, we will determine the requirements of the \TheProject{} project as a whole, identifying the main technical challenges that must be addressed by the \TheProject{} approach. We will also identify big-data analytics databases, filesystems, frameworks and libraries that will be targeted in the project. The identified  requirements will be fed into each of the technical work packages, forming a foundation for the design and implementation of the associated methods and tools. We will also determine KPIs for achieving the overall expected impacts (Section~\ref{knowledgeprotection}), application-specific success criteria for each already existing use case, plus the associated measurement criteria. As a part of this task, we will also devise a certain level of business oriented semantics for multilevel security requirements allocation, detecting potential sensitive business data leaks and planning for building the bridge between business and programmatic views. This task will proceed in two phases. In the \emph{first} phase, we will determine the KPIs, create clear definitions, and undertake the baseline measurement of existing use cases (reported in \ref{del:req1}). This will later be refined in the \emph{second} phase to take into account feedback from the initial implementations of the use cases, resulting in \ref{del:req2}. This will allow a precise measure of success to be defined for each use case, without over-generalisation. All of the project partners will contribute to this task.

\tasklabel{task:datafab}
In \theTask{}, we will adapt the \IBMshort{} Data Fabrication Platform in order to produce synthetic, but realistic, datasets for the use cases that will be considered. The use case partners will analyse the data from their use cases, and derive, together with \IBMshort{}, the rules and relationships required to generate synthetic data. These rules will then be used to produce arbitrary volumes of synthetic data, as required for development and evaluation of the use cases. This will have a number of benefits, allowing evaluation of the \TheProject{} technologies from their early stages on realistic use cases without the privacy issues arising from the use of real data. It will also allow us to stress-test the system, as we will be able to generate arbitrarily large volumes of data and test the system on it. \IBMshort{} will lead the task, providing expertise in using the IBM Data Fabrication Platform, which will be used by \FRQshort{} and \SOPRAshort{} for their use cases.

In \theTask{}, we will develop the use case applications that will be used to evaluate the \TheProject{} technology in a realistic setting. The use cases will be used to test our technology as a whole, in realistic conditions, using both synthetic data produced using data fabrication, as well as realistic data (where feasible). 
%We will also support a certain level of business oriented semantics for multilevel security requirements allocation, detecting potential sensitive business data leaks and start building the bridge between business views (for instance Air Traffic Management data vs Unmanned Traffic Management data if it makes sense that they have different security requirements) and programmatic views.

\textbf{Air Traffic Management (\FRQshort{}).} 
%% VJ: Move this to the background section
%To address the use case described in section \ref{sec:atm} the Frequentis MosaiX SWIM aviation integration platform is used which provides tools and applications that ANSPs need to overcome these challenges and to facilitate the exchange of information between all industry stakeholders for better-informed decision making and shared situational awareness. It is specifically designed to assist the Aviation industry with its migration to SWIM and to facilitate the exchange of information between all industry stakeholders for better informed decision making and the creation of new applications and services. This reduces vendor lock-in by allowing customers to substitute components and incorporate new technologies in the future. The outcome of this project will ensure that one of the key benefits, is ensured in a comprehensive security solution.
In this use case, we will extend the Frequentis MosaiX SWIM aviation integration platform (described in Section~\ref{sec:atm}), to ensure a comprehensive security solution by detecting and repairing vulnerabilities in the platform. In addition, the customisable metrics and dashboards will be extended by the machine learning outcomes produced within this project. MosaiX SWIM represents a fundamental shift from todayâ€™s monolithic solutions, where adopting new technologies requires re-engineering the whole system. We will focus on the scenario of \emph{drone deconfliction}. To perform strategic deconfliction, the flight path of one of the conflicting drones needs to be altered at the leg between two way points at which the conflict takes place. One drone should ascend, the other drone should descend. A conflict occurs if two or more drones flying along their planned flight paths come into close proximity with each other. To be able to perform 4D conflict detection we will need to know the drone flight path way points in 3D space and the planned time of arrival for each way point. For tactical conflict resolution the shortest vector from an approaching other drone shall be calculated and executed immediately. However, such capability is expected to be built into the drone itself, not requiring any external input or network. \emph{We want to prove that we can secure a distribute coding base ranging over several different domains without compromising the overall ecosystem.}

\textbf{Digital Banking (\SOPRAshort{}).} \emph{Digital banking} is the digitisation (or transferring online) of all traditional banking activities and processing services that were historically only available to customers when physically inside of a bank branch. Customers are now performing ``touch-less'' transactions with money deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers executed on mobile devices. The transaction touch-point is now migrated to customers' mobile phones and tablets. Providers that traditionally would have had a fix address (e.g. place of business) are now mobile, as  mobile devices can now be converted into card terminals. The traditional trusted end-point security model is now disrupted into a \emph{zero trust architecture}. The addition of Internet-of-Things transactions (e.g. train access gates, unmanned shops and push button ordering devices) means the stable environment of banking is now open to the revolution in the information age. \emph{We want to secure each component to ensure the specific step in the digital banking process is secure and trusted. The core issue is that the different processing steps are no longer solely under the control of the traditional banking ecosystem.}

\textbf{Healthcare (\SOPRAshort{}).} The world is globalising at an ever-increasing rate. Global healthcare is becoming a major impact on the global environment, relating to economical impact and ease of travel between countries.  The rise in global health care costs is causing a disruption to the traditional healthcare model, as patient demographics is now evolving to a model of medical cover in specific home countries. This evolving consumer expectation is generating new market verticals. Complex health and technology ecosystems are forcing new data sharing agreements and requirements onto the global health care providers. People now invest in value-add care, advanced digital technologies and innovative care delivery requirements. At the core of this is a massive set of ever-increasing data interchange and processing requirements. Global healthcare needs a \emph{zero trust architecture} to support these uncertainties in security, and build a smart health ecosystem that can meet the current and future healthcare model. \emph{We want to show that by securing the processing within the core healthcare ecosystem, we create a secure internal architecture.}

In \theTask{}, we will evaluate the \TheProject{} tools and technologies against the overall project requirements and success criteria that were identified in~\ref{task:requirements}, using the representative metrics and use cases that were developed in~\ref{task:usecases}. We aim to evaluate those aspects that contribute to the impact from the industrial partners within the selected domains. We will evaluate how much the security and privacy of the data, including for any data analytics models, is improved, by using the \TheProject{} techniques. This includes simulated cyber-attacks for testing. We will also evaluate how easy it is for end users to use the \TheProject{} methodology for developing secure distributed data analytics applications. The lessons learned from this task will provide feedback into different technical work packages, steering the development of \TheProject{} technologies in the subsequent phases of the project. We will also undertake roadmapping activities for future \TheProject{} technologies. This roadmapping will be in the context of emerging technical developments in  secure distributed AI-based big data analytics applications, and also in broadening the long-term impact of the \TheProject{} project. This roadmap will consider new and emerging developments in security, privacy, AI, data lakes, cloud computing, etc., as they relate to the analytics of big data. It will highlight possible future applications of the \TheProject{} technology, and indicate the further work that needs to be done to bring the \TheProject{} technologies to market (\ref{del:eval3}). All of the project partners will participate in this task, evaluating the techniques they will develop for the use cases, and providing expertise for the overall project roadmap.
%The result of this task will be a report describing the technical roadmap, highlighting the issues for future research and use of \TheProject{} technology, also being used as input for T8.2 (Exploitation and Use).
