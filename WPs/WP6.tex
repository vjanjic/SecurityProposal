\begin{WPObjectives}
The objectives of \theWP{} are to:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Develop new refactorings that repair security vulnerabilities.
\item Develop new refactorings that rewrite source-code so that it conforms to a security-aware coding standard.
\item Develop new refactorings that introduce security-aware patterns into the source-code.
\item Develop new security-aware patterns.
\item Develop a new security-aware software engineering methodology for the development of secure big-data applications.
\item Develop a new C++ coding standard for the development of security-aware big-data applications.


\end{compactitem}
\end{WPObjectives}

\begin{WPDescription}
This workpackage will investigate new software engineering techniques and tools for the development of security-aware big-data applications. We will develop new end-user refactoring tool support in \ref{task:refactoring}; new security-aware software development patterns in \ref{task:patterns}, that will be provided to the user in the form of a new software library, with refactoring tool-support for their introduction in \ref{task:refactoring}; a new security-aware software engineering methodology in \ref{task:methodology}, encapsulating new software engineering methods and techniques from all the tools developed as part of the \TheProject{} project. In \ref{task:standards}, we will develop a new C++ coding standard for the development of secure big-data applications in C++. Finally, in \ref{task:interoper}, we will enable interoperability between the tools developed in the other workpackages to form a coherent software tool-chain and methodology for the end-user.

In this task we will develop an end-user front-end that will provide a user interface to the various tools implemented in the project. This will include ... 
The web-based front end will provide an interactive dashboard for ...
The refactoring tool will be integrated into the ParaFormance refactoring tool, supporting both Eclipse and Visual-Studio for C++ applications. A prototype implementation for Java-based applications will also be produced. The results of this task will be used to refactor the use-cases in \ref{wp:usecases}.



%
%In particular, in this task we will produce new refactorings that will:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Repair vulnerable code, by taking the output of the Self Healing tooling from XX, 
%	\item Introduce security-aware patterns, based on the implementation of the patterns in Task X.
%	\item Rewrite source-code so that it conforms to the standard as defined in Task X.
%\end{itemize}

In \theTask{} we will formalise and implement patterns of security that arise in typical big-data applications. As part of this process, we will investigate the relationship between common security threats and their source-level solutions, producing a high-level domain-specific language (DSL) for describing a set of design patterns for the end-user. This DSL will be made available to the end-user developer as a library of security-aware patterns and will be used by the refactoring tooling from \ref{task:refactoring}. The DSL will be implemented in C++, using advanced features from the latest C++ standards, abstracting away the low-level details of programming security models.

The task will proceed in three phases. In the \emph{first} phase, we will identify a set of \emph{fundamental} patterns for repairing security vulnerabilities. These patterns will reported as high-level schemas, encapsulating the side-conditions to the pattern, the semantics of the pattern, and design models of the the pattern's implementation.
In the \emph{second} phase, we will provide implementations of the fundamental security patterns from the first phase, implemented as a C++ library. In the \emph{third} and final phase, we will extend the fundamental set of patterns, to include some advanced security patterns, and their prototype implementations in C++. If time permits, we will also provide prototype implementations of the fundamental patterns for Java-like languages.

	In \theTask, we will develop new C++ coding and security standard to facilitate programming of secure big-data applications. The task will proceed in two phases. First, we will identify those properties that arise in security-aware applications, such as secrecy of variables, branching vulnerabilities, etc.; secondly, we will implement a new security-aware programming standard, encapsulating the properties from the first phase, to create a new C++ coding standard. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Identify the language-properties relating to security 
		\item vulnerabilities, branching, etc.? non-functional properties?
		\item create a new C++ coding style/standard.

	In \theTask, we will produce a new software engineering methodology for the development of secure-aware big-data applications. In this task, we will look to assess the suitability of the tools and techniques developed within the project to support different software development models. 
	In the first phase of this task, we will assess existing  software engineering methods and their applicability to develop secure-aware applications for big data.
	In the second phase of this task, we will assess the applicability of the individual tools and techniques developed on the \TheProject{} project, and their applicability to a secure-aware software methodology. 
	Finally, in the final phase of this task, we will ensure interoperability of the tools produced in WP2, WP3, WP4, WP5 and WP6, producing an interoperable secure-aware tool-chain
	\begin{itemize}
		\item requirements capture (software engineering based?)
		\item software development models?
		\item assess applicability of tools ?

	\tasklabel{task:SastToFeedRefactoring}
	
	In \theTask, we can investigate how our way of doing static analysis can feed the semi automated refactoring process and tool. For instance we can search and detect specific properties of the source code, be they certain or uncertain (code smells), correlate them to find if a certain pattern is met and feed the refactoring.
	We also can provide decision making information out of static analysis on "which code to refactor", on detected pre conditions as well as providing potential different options, based on semantics, to feed the refactoring.
	\color{blue} \textbf{Limitation:} It will not be possible to modify the static analysis intermediate representation to adapt to refactoring specific needs.
